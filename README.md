# Playwright BDD Framework with Cucumber and Gherkin

This repository contains a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) test automation framework using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and Gherkin. The framework enables writing test scenarios in a human-readable format while leveraging Playwright for UI automation.

## Repository
GitHub Repository: [bdd-playwright-cucumber](https://github.com/janahbeatriz/bdd-playwright-cucumber)

## Features
- **BDD Support**: Uses Cucumber with Gherkin for writing test scenarios.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports execution in multiple browsers.
- **Headless/Headful Mode**: Run tests in both headless and headed modes.
- **Easy Configuration**: Uses `cucumber.json` for test settings.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before setting up the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
